### Professional Self-Assessment

As far as I remember, I have always been fond of creating things, designing or exploring the various ranges of creativity. I have been a visual person with strong liking for colors, graphics or details. While coding did not interest me at all back home, most probably, because I was conveniently unaware about computer science field and its scope during those periods, but this viewpoint took a complete turn as time went by. In the meantime, I moved to the United States and I sensed a need to update my career prospects for the better job security and satisfaction. I decided to further my studies.  

Coming to SNHU, I realized the courses that were based on visual exposition captivated me a lot and some of them were namely CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization where I learnt about creating three-dimensional objects using OpenGL language, API libraries and computer graphics development best practices. The class also equipped me with knowledge to create interactive graphics applications that would allow navigation around the three-dimensional object created. Another class that fascinated me was IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design, where I learnt to apply object-oriented techniques and methods in analyzing and designing software systems. Precisely, I was introduced to create UML functional, structural and behavioral models that are clearly articulated and based on software system requirements. I discovered that a whole software application can be illustrated in the relevant UML diagrams. Subsequently, I realized that a software developer can contribute to the development of computer graphics and for myself, as an aspiring computer science professional, I can pursue this field as a career choice as well.  

SNHU offered me more than these two opportunities to learn and broaden my horizon. For example, through the class CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle, I learnt about the impact of various roles to the software development process. I was introduced to the agile development methodologies in relation to efficient completion of software design projects. I got a chance to conduct various communication approaches relative to the roles, such as product owner, scrum master, developer, tester at different stages of the software design process. Similarly, taking a class CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, I was able to know more about software-engineering testing strategies and practices while learning how software quality assurance techniques are used through the software development life cycle. The biggest takeaways from this class I would say are learning to incorporate the Test-driven development (TDD) and to limit the bias I may have as a developer or a tester throughout the software development process. 

Similarly, CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms was quite insightful as a class, as I got an opportunity to apply technically sound data structures and algorithms to perform the various required functions including searches and sorts. The knowledge helped me much while writing efficient and optimized computer programs in my other classes and projects as well. Through class such as DAT 220: Fundamentals of Data Mining, I learnt a lot about identifying meaningful patterns in a data by using strategies such as hypothesis testing and data-driven discovery methods. Here I was introduced to a statistical analysis program called JMP to conduct data-mining tasks such as classification, clustering and sequential pattern discovery and generate research questions by using the right data mining and research techniques.  

Taking CS 310: Collaboration and Team Project, I became much aware about utilizing appropriate industry-standard tools and techniques for version control in software development and applied collaboration strategies for addressing team-level software development environments. I also assessed the collaborative process for its ability to promote effective communication in team-based development projects. CS 410: Reverse Software Engineering  whereas, taught me about recovering, recreating and rewriting the code for applications by focusing on assembly code which acts as a bridge between machine code and the higher-level coding languages.  

In addition to all these, some of the other worth mentioning classes that came along my way were IT 145: Foundation in Application Development that exposed me to the design, implementation and understanding of computer programs. Here I learnt about the key concepts of object orientation, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and communication with messages. Topics such as classes and objects, base classes and class hierarchies, and abstract and concrete classes were explored as well. And In the class IT 365: Operating Environments, I came across the major components of operating systems and their role in supporting different processes. I analyzed how process and memory management function within an operating system during application development and analyzed operating systems on how they approach user protection and security.  

With time and my studying at SNHU, my thinking about my impending career plan has evolved for sure. Now I have realized that there are so many routes that, as a computer science professional, I can take and not be restricted or limited to one area of specialization only. With so much strength and skills that I have garnered from taking several classes, some of which I have discussed in the above paragraphs, I feel I am now prepared to enter the professional scene of the computer science field and contribute in the most productive way possible. Though I intend to pursue my career choices in computer graphics direction, Artificial Intelligence, Game Design and Software Engineering also fascinate my imaginations a lot. I hope in future, I will be able to somehow combine my passion for creative expositions with programming skills in one or couple of these specialization areas of Computer Science.

### Final Portfolio Summary

While picking the artifacts for my ePortfolio, I was guided by this desire to explore those areas in all three categories that I have never been to and that I can investigate some opportunities that would be appealing for others to review as well. A common theme running throughout my artifacts enhancements is about being visual and/ or interactive. I have named the proposed enhancements separately to display the intent in each of the cases that are being discussed as follows. 

_Controlling the ram head through GUI_ 

For the Software Design and Engineering category, I chose to go with a project from the course CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. The project for this class ended with writing code for the ram head with a texture and giving some control to users to zoom in and out and turn horizontally and vertically. My enhancement plan is to develop GUI so to display to users the instructions to maneuver around the ram head and the settings to adjust the position and the rotational degree of the head as well. The intent is to make the codes look less intimidating but more playful for users with non-technical background. 

The enhancement plan demonstrates the gained skills to use innovative techniques and tools to implement in the field of computer graphics, the area of specialization that I am planning to go for in future. The outcome these skills align to is a display of an attempt to expand on a project’s complexity by adding further functionalities via GUI to control the ram head. 

------------------------------------------------------- 

_Creating an application using a different API_ 

For the Algorithms and Data Structure category, I decided to explore the concepts of making a RESTful API from the course CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This project ended with making a RESTful (API) based protocol that was enabled with specific CRUD functionalities. The enhancement plan I am proposing in my portfolio is to explore and use other freely available APIs such as COVID-19 tracking API to create an application that would display visual information if not data information regarding the status of COVID cases all over the world and in the states of USA in this trying time. This is achieved by writing source codes in Python that would make use of two API’s available online to create an application of some use. 

The enhancement plan demonstrates the skills to solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices. These skills in turn align to course outcomes such as an attempt to improve efficiency of the chosen artifact or the concepts behind API in this case by using a different algorithm and the free API created by other resources. 

------------------------------------------------------- 

_Creating a graphical database_ 

For the Database category, I chose the idea of MongoDB from the course CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. All the databases used for this class were not graphical at all with lot of them having readability factor almost non-existent. My intended plan is to explore a way to create a visual display of a database that has been used for this class. This is an attempt to make a huge database look much easier for interpretation and analysis.  

The enhancement plan illustrates the skills to explore the techniques and tools that help implement computer solutions and help accomplish industry-specific goals. The outcome these skills align to is the presentation of a JSON database in a graphical format using a different tool and a programming language than what were used previously for the class.

### Software Design and Engineering

For the Software Design/ Engineering category, the artifact that I picked is the ram head modeling and navigation from the class CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. This artifact was created to showcase an example of an organized geometry with low-polygon while representing a real-world object. A suitable texture was utilized here and was given a look of a sculpture with appropriate lighting to highlight the ram head’s features.

The reason I selected this artifact for my final project was because I thought I could expand on the complexity of the application that I created for the class CS 330. I, as well intend to improve this application further by involving the users in some way as before everything was in code and it was only the programmers who know how to navigate around the ram head or how to change the settings of navigation to one’s desires. The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in software development would be the preparations of the environment in terms of Eclipse IDE that were conducted before even introducing the idea of GUI to the whole picture. There were lot of research and analysis done to set the environment by downloading the correct header libraries and then placing them in the right positions to start designing GUI of my choice. I downloaded the ImGui library and wrote specific ImGui functions to facilitate the graphical user interface in the otherwise quite static and closed application but have to admit that I struggled a lot to get the library work correctly. 

I faced a lot of challenges while carrying out this project. The first one was having to download the software application with all required libraries and folders, and this was after the class was over and done with. Once the application was up and running, then I had to go through old tutorials and do a lot of reading to understand what was being done in my old assignments. After this, I had to study a lot about how to create a GUI over the screen that holds a 3d object already. I came to know there were many GUI libraries that one can use, but some of them that topped the list were Dear ImGui, FlatGui, GLUI etc. After this, I downloaded ImGui as it looked like the most preferred option.

The header files were quite complicated to understand in one attempt. In case of ImGui, I came to learn that the here the header files and some selected source files have to be together in the same folder for me to be able to use some of the Gui functions in code and avoid any ‘undefined references’. I understood the strategy to create Gui and all the required artifacts within the interface, but the preliminary actions that I was required to take before even starting to code Gui is what took me so much time. Now my IDE is reading out an error message saying that it cannot find -lglfw library, and it is there but with a different name glfw3. 

So what I learnt through the whole process is that the software design and development is not an easy process to talk about and especially when you are the only one in the design and development process setting goals and making decisions. I also learnt about the importance of all the preliminary steps that need to be carried out to get the software application working to your desire. It maybe because I lack professional experience and aimed for some bigger project goals that I faced some serious challenges, but eventually I scaled back to see if I can create a simple functioning Gui for this project. The picture below is the intended result of this enhancement.

![New Project (6) (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73665341/101970800-a883ba00-3bfa-11eb-8df2-e2877dd31361.jpg)


Following is a snippet of code to create the GUI feature over the ram head on the screen.

```c++

//glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);
if (!glfwInit()) {exit(EXIT_FAILURE);}

// Setup Dear ImGui context
IMGUI_CHECKVERSION();

ImGui::CreateContext();
ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO(); (void)io;

// Setup platform/ Renderer bindings
GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(WIDTH, HEIGHT, "OpenGL", NULL, NULL);

// Initializing
ImGui_ImplGlfw_InitForOpenGL(window, true);
ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_Init("#version 130");
// Setup Dear ImGui style
ImGui::StyleColorsDark();

// loop until the user closes the window
while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))
{
	glfwPollEvents();
	glClearColor(0.45f, 0.55f, 0.6f, 1.00f);
	glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

	//feed inputs to dear imgui, start new frame
	ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_NewFrame();
	ImGui::NewFrame();

	// rendering a simple GUI that offers control to users (over the ram head)
	ImGui::Begin("Ram Head Rotation/ Position");
	ImGui::Text("Hello, press the ALT key and left mouse button to rotate" 
		    "the ram head horizontally and ALT key and right mouse"
	            "button to zoom in and out.");

	const float PI = 3.1415927;
	static float rotation = 0.0;
	ImGui::SliderFloat("Rotation", &rotation, 0, 2 * PI);

	static float translation[] = {0.0, 0.0};
	ImGui::SliderFloat2("Position", translation, -1.0, 1.0);
	ImGui::End();

	// Render dear ImGui onto the screen
	ImGui::Render();
	ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_RenderDrawData(ImGui::GetDrawData());

	int display_w, display_h;
	glfwGetFramebufferSize(window, &display_w, &display_h);
	glViewport(0, 0, display_w, display_h);
	glfwSwapBuffers(window);
}
ImGui_ImplOpenGL3_Shutdown();
ImGui::DestroyContext();

```

### Algorithms and Data Structure

The artifact chosen for Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure is RESTful (API) web-based protocol from CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This framework was here enabled with specific CRUD functionality and is tested and validated by using URIs linked in the prompt. Also, a web service application was developed to implement the RESTful API for a MongoDB database and this involved some advanced querying. 

Making a RESTful API grew my interest to know more about how APIs developed by other resources would function and what kind of benefits can one take out of them. I selected this artifact because as a computer science student, I got inspired to explore further on this whole idea of creating API artifact and see now if I can use freely available APIs and independently make any application that can be of some use to general people. Though I did mention in my first refinement plan of displaying visual information through the application designed but had to scale back after learning that it might require some dedicated studying and application development planning to add the visual factor to the whole presentation of database extracted from API. Hopefully this will be my future project I will pursue later on.

For this enhancement plan, I wrote the code in Python with various functionalities that were inspired from CRUD functionality in a developed RESTful API framework and integrated two different APIs to offer two options so as to display the latest information regarding COVID-19 virus to the users. Instead of MongoDB, here this application uses the sea of information offered by the API’s to bring forward the requested information. The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure would be the strategies employed to make others’ API work to my desire. As the algorithms used to make the most out of a free API (or data structure) are different than what was used with RESTful API for CS 340, I believe they will successfully highlight my achieved skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure in the process.

Following are the screenshot of the code snippets in Python and the compiled code in python shell. The API’s have made it easier and efficient to get the data from anywhere in the world and around the United States quite effortlessly. My understanding of algorithms and data structures got much stronger and informed after making this application. Hopefully the next step in future is to make this application much portable in apps format. I may need more investigations and research to go in that direction. 

```python

import requests

# to get information about the international country
def by_country():
    name = input('Enter country: ')

    # url address of the API in question concatenated with the name of the country
    url = 'https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/countries/' + (name)
    # Sending http request to get the data above into python script
    res = requests.get(url)

    # to get the data in JSON format
    data = res.json()

    #to get the desired data/ individual elements from the data
    cases = data['cases']
    recovered = data['recovered']
    active = data['active']
    critical = data['critical']
    deaths = data['deaths']

    todayCases = data['todayCases']
    todayDeaths = data['todayDeaths']

    print()
    print('Total Cases : {}'.format(cases))
    print('Total recovered : {}'.format(recovered))
    print('Total active : {}'.format(active))
    print('Total critical : {}'.format(critical))
    print('TOtal deaths : {}'.format(deaths))
    print()
    print('Cases registered today : {}'.format(todayCases))
    print('Deaths registered today : {}'.format(todayDeaths))


# to get information of the different states in USA itself
def by_USstate():
    state = input('Enter the state in USA: ')

    # url address of the API in question formatted with the state of the country
    url = 'https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/{0}/current.json'.format(state)

    # Sending http request to get the data above into python script
    res = requests.get(url)

    # to get the data in JSON format
    data = res.json()

    #to get the desired data/ individual elements from the data
    date = data['date']
    total = data['total']
    recovered = data['recovered']
    hospitalized = data['hospitalized']
    hospitalizedIncrease = data['hospitalizedIncrease']
    death = data['death']
    deathIncrease = data['deathIncrease']

    hospitalizedCurrently = data['hospitalizedCurrently']
    inIcuCurrently = data['inIcuCurrently']
    onVentilatorCurrently = data['onVentilatorCurrently']

    print()
    print('Date of the published data : {}'.format(date))
    print('Total Cases : {}'.format(total))
    print('Total recovered : {}'.format(recovered))
    print('Total hospitalized : {}'.format(hospitalized))
    print('Total hospitalized increase : {}'.format(hospitalizedIncrease))
    print('Total deaths : {}'.format(death))
    print('Total increase in deaths : {}'.format(deathIncrease))
    print()
    print('Total hospitalized today : {}'.format(hospitalizedCurrently))
    print('Total in ICU today : {}'.format(inIcuCurrently))
    print('Total on ventilator today : {}'.format(onVentilatorCurrently))


def main():
    print('Welcome.')
    print('This application uses two specific APIs to bring forth to you,')
    print('the information regarding COVID-19 status around us.')
    choice = ''

    while(choice != '3'):
        print()
        print('1. Get data by country')
        print('2. Get data by US state')
        print('3. Exit')
        print()

        choice = input('Enter your choice : ')
                
        if choice == '1':
            by_country()
            
        elif choice == '2':
            by_USstate()        
            
        elif choice == '3':
            print('Bye.')

        else:
            print('Try again.')

    print('Thank you.')

if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
    
```

Running the program.

This is the first time I am making a simple application of some use while using the freely available API on the internet. The process left me thinking more about a lot of other APIs that I may have skipped or missed exploring. The experience taught me that the sky is the limit to what can be done with any API that are just thrown to us at disposal. 
The challenges I faced while making this simple application was trying to get hold of the appropriate API that can be used in my application. There were several APi’s being offered online that are tracking COVID-19 cases in their own set variables, so it was a struggle for me to get the right API that I can use to create the application I was planning. Some APi’s demand time and understanding to learn how to work around them, and some even required money, but finally I was able to use two of them that met my specifications of the application. 

Also, I was planning to make a web application somewhere in the line of apps on mobile cell phones, but in the middle, I realized that I have to spend much time to understand the various technical details to make this application web based, but with whatever work I was able to accomplish making it a computer application, I feel motivated to keep working on this application to convert it to a platforms- friendly one and make it more available for everybody meaning even for the audience who are not from the computer science field or technical background.

### Database
The artifact chosen for Enhancement Three: Databases is MongoDB concepts from CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. The artifact precisely is the ‘city_inspections.json’ file that was used extensively throughout the term along with other JSON files to carry out various exercises. Below is a glimpse of how it looked online before we tried to make it readable by querying through Mongo in the command prompt. 

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73665341/101971792-e0423000-3c01-11eb-93dc-63bc7bce75a7.JPG)
 
The compelling reason I included this artifact in my ePortfolio was to see if I can create a ‘graphical database’ of a JSON file that I have used for the MongoDB projects in the class CS 340. All the databases that were used for this class were not visual, with some of them so huge that the readability factor was almost nonexistent, unless one writes some intelligent queries. My intended enhancement plan here is to present graphical displays of a JSON database that I have used for the MongoDB projects in this class. It is also to make the huge database look visually easier for interpretation and analysis by using a different tool and a language than what were used earlier for the class.
The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in software development would be the exploration and implementation of a previous class project in a different application and a programming language. Hopefully, they will highlight the gained abilities to explore the different potential techniques and tools to help reach the computer solutions and accomplish industry-specific goals in my future ventures. 

Here, I am using a different application called ‘neo4j’, that is a graph database management system developed by Neo4j Inc. and am also using the Cypher query language (CQL) to query through the database to display the given data in graphical formats. So, in order to work on the artifact enhancement, first I downloaded the said software, neo4j and installed the related APOC (Awesome Procedures for Cypher) library and also learnt some basics of Cypher to write queries. I then focused my attention on this specific part of the artifact as shown below, where I am writing a query in Mongo to lay out the details of the businesses, who belong to the same zip code 11242 of New York state.

![3-2-a2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73665341/101971814-197aa000-3c02-11eb-9b5f-f40ed6ad6372.jpg)

I carried out numerous queries in neo4j and hence reached some graphical representations as below. The circles represent the nodes that represent the entities, the first ones created are for the businesses in NY. Each business node, when clicked would reveal the properties such as id, certificate_number, date and address. There are nodes for sector, result and zip entities as well. Relationships between these nodes are shown by the arrows that connect the created nodes in the space. Relationships organize the nodes into structures that can resemble a list, a tree, or a map.

![17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73665341/101971870-7b3b0a00-3c02-11eb-8ce8-eec5e0273f44.JPG)

So, in the above scene from the neo4j interface,  there are: 
1. 5 business nodes in red color
2. 4 result nodes in green
3. 2 sector nodes in brown
4. 1 zip node in pink

Relationship types are shown by terms such as 
- “BELONGS_TO”
- “RESULTED_TO”, and 
- “IS_OF_TYPE”.

The graphical representation of the database here shows that all 5 businesses belong to the same zip code, but they share different relationships with the results and the sector types they pertain to. Extending and easing the nodes showcase the relationships between the various nodes/ entities in quite a lucid way, as seen in the graphic below.

![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73665341/101971884-a02f7d00-3c02-11eb-9937-e39099998f1c.JPG)

After looking at the above structural display of nodes, it is evident that it is so much easier to deduce information out of the graphical database right away. Visuals always help as they are less intimidating than the humongous collection of entities and their properties like seen in the almost every JSON file. In the case above, now one can see the names of all the five businesses that belong to the same zip number 11242 and their respective information in terms of entities such as sector and result all at the same time. I believe, this is how the chosen artifact has been improvised here in this case. 


FEATURES OF GRAPHICAL DATABASE:
* Making a graphical database has many advantages to talk about. Now it is easier to query and visually ensure the correctness of the code as well. An example, now one can see the visual node itself and the result in table format like in SQL as well, to make sure the code is right, and the query result is correct. Please see the query written after neo4j$ prompts on the top.

![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73665341/101972528-e2f15500-3c02-11eb-9714-78937979b0a3.JPG)

* It is also easier now to focus on any distinct nodes and the relationships they share in the mammoth sea of nodes and relationships. This can quickly derive visual information right away for the concerned parties. While SQL is about rows and columns with a lot of information in between lines, neo4j is about giving away prompt information through intelligent queries written. In the screenshot below, we can see that there is query written to know what kind of sector the business belongs to and what is the result of the business all at the same time. This is just a small example of how we can get visual information about any business in a JSON file quite easily in neo4j. 

![16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73665341/101972997-04524100-3c03-11eb-928a-93bb87621d81.JPG)

CQL is a vast patterns-based language, just like SQL and it will take some time and motivation for anybody to master the full control over this language. The neo4j application is not as complex as it may seem from outside, but the intricacies of the Cypher language were. Personally, it was a big learning experience for me to go through this process of enhancing the database artifact. I think I attempted to achieve something that may have taken some full month’s long training maybe, as during the process, I was still not clear on a lot of concepts, but I tried and stepped onto the areas that I have never been to and now am offering some work for reviews. Exploring neo4j and Cypher language for this enhancement taught me that many times, we have to change our perceptions and work strategies to learn something new and gain knowledge to compare the results. I am now quite motivated to research more on this application and language and see if I can create some future projects myself, such as creating some kind of graphical database on my family tree or something of that nature.

Talking about the challenges I faced during the enhancement I would like to bring up the instances in the project when the same business names are repeating such as NZE CORP. and SHARDA OFFICE SUPPLIES INC., maybe it is the same owner registering the same  business names more than once in the NY city. I could establish the businesses as nodes with the same names, but when it came to setting properties such as ID or certificate number, the system would get confused and kept assigning the change to every business with the same name, but this was not what I would want to happen because though some names were the same, their properties varied. I researched online for solutions to this issue but could not find any defined solutions as such, so I finally tweaked the names of the businesses by adding 1 or 2 to their ends. I am sure, there is a way to work around this ailing problem, but after I sensed I was spending much time on it, I had to give in for the modifications in the names as a fix.

As I got curious to know how a big database such as city_inspections.json would work in neo4j, I started exploring this database as a whole to see if I can create some interesting graphics with full of information. I loaded the ‘city_inspections.json’ file from its GitHub location and I wrote queries in Cypher to output the intended actions in graphical versions.  Here, something different was being done, because the JSON file was being loaded to neo4j to bring in all the pre-made nodes and relationships, which was quite opposite than the first case when I am creating the nodes and their relationship myself from the data queried in Mongo. After importing the JSON file and writing the queries as seen above, I was able to create the nodes for business, sector, result and their inter relationship for every single business, but I faced a major problem when I could not create the extended relationships among all 300 businesses via their sectors and results all at the same time. 

While I could create the visible display of all business nodes and the relationships with sectors and results in NY but could not show the interconnection the business nodes share with one another via the sectors of the businesses and the results they received. The result, one can see a lot of repeated and redundant entities floating around, such as Home Improvement node, No Violation Issued node etc. when one single node could have replaced the many duplicates. The graphic does not look like a tree or a map but instead looks like separate floating coat hangers in space. I intend to keep working at it in future. Hopefully, I would get the right picture that looks well justified.
