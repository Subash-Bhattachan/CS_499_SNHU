## Professional Self-Assessment
Always been fond of creating things, designing or exploring the various ranges of creativity, I have been a visual person with strong liking for colors, graphics or details. While coding did not interest me at all back home, most probably, because I was conveniently unaware about computer science field and its scope during those periods, but this viewpoint took a complete turn as time went by. In the meantime, I moved to the United States and I sensed a need to update my career prospects for the better job security and satisfaction. I decided to further my studies.  

Coming to SNHU, I realized the courses that were based on visual exposition captivated me a lot and some of them were namely CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization where I learnt about creating three-dimensional objects using OpenGL language, API libraries and computer graphics development best practices. The class also equipped me with knowledge to create interactive graphics applications that would allow navigation around the three-dimensional object created. Another class that fascinated me was IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design, where I learnt to apply object-oriented techniques and methods in analyzing and designing software systems. Precisely, I learnt to create UML functional, structural and behavioral models that are clearly articulated and based on software system requirements. I discovered that a whole software application can be illustrated in the relevant UML diagrams. Subsequently, I realized that a software developer can contribute to the development of computer graphics and for myself, as an aspiring computer science professional, I can pursue this field as a career choice as well.  

SNHU offered me more than these two opportunities to learn and broaden my horizon. For example, through the class CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle, I learnt about the impact of various roles to the software development process. I was introduced to the agile development methodologies in relation to efficient completion of software design projects. I got a chance to conduct various communication approaches relative to the roles, such as product owner, scrum master, developer, tester at different stages of the software design process. Similarly, taking a class CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, I was able to know more about software-engineering testing strategies and practices while learning how software quality assurance techniques are used through the software development life cycle. The biggest takeaways from this class I would say are learning to incorporate the Test-driven development (TDD) and to limit the bias I may have as a developer or a tester throughout the software development process. 

Similarly, CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms was quite insightful as a class, as I got an opportunity to apply technically sound data structures and algorithms to perform the various required functions including searches and sorts. The knowledge helped me much while writing efficient and optimized computer programs in my other classes and projects as well. Through class such as DAT 220: Fundamentals of Data Mining, I learnt a lot about identifying meaningful patterns in a data by using strategies such as hypothesis testing and data-driven discovery methods. Here I was introduced to a statistical analysis program called JMP to conduct data-mining tasks such as classification, clustering and sequential pattern discovery and generate research questions by using the right data mining and research techniques.  

Taking CS 310: Collaboration and Team Project, I became much aware about utilizing appropriate industry-standard tools and techniques for version control in software development and applied collaboration strategies for addressing team-level software development environments. I also assessed the collaborative process for its ability to promote effective communication in team-based development projects. CS 410: Reverse Software Engineering  whereas, taught me about recovering, recreating and rewriting the code for applications by focusing on assembly code which acts as a bridge between machine code and the higher-level coding languages.  

Some of the worth mentioning classes that came along my way are IT 145: Foundation in Application Development that exposed me to the design, implementation and understanding of computer programs. Here I learnt about the key concepts of object orientation, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and communication with messages. Topics such as classes and objects, base classes and class hierarchies, and abstract and concrete classes were explored as well. And In the class IT 365: Operating Environments, I came across the major components of operating systems and their role in supporting different processes. I analyzed how process and memory management function within an operating system during application development and analyzed operating systems on how they approach user protection and security.  

With time and my studying at SNHU, my thinking about my career plan has evolved for sure. Now I have realized that there are so many routes that as a computer science professional I can take and not be restricted or limited to one area of specialization only. With so much strength and skills that I have garnered from taking several classes, some of which I have discussed in the above paragraphs, I feel I am now prepared to enter the professional scene of the computer science field and contribute in the most productive way possible. Though I intend to pursue my career choices in computer graphics direction, Artificial Intelligence, Game Design and Software Engineering also fascinate my imaginations a lot. I hope in future, I will be able to somehow combine my love for creative expositions with programming skills in one or couple of these specialization areas of Computer Science. 

### Summary of the improvised artifacts
Controlling the ram head through GUI 

For the Software Design and Engineering category, I have chosen to go with a project from the course CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. The project for this class ended with writing code for the ram head with a texture and giving some control to users to zoom in and out and turn horizontally and vertically. My enhancement plan is to develop GUI so to display to users the instructions to maneuver around the ram head and the settings to adjust the position and the rotational degree of the head as well. The intent is to make the codes look less intimidating but more playful for users with non-technical background. 

The enhancement plan demonstrates the gained skills to use innovative techniques and tools to implement in the field of computer graphics, the area of specialization that I am planning to go for in future. The outcome these skills align to is a display of an attempt to expand on a project’s complexity by adding further functionalities via GUI to control the ram head.

Creating an application using a different API 

For the Algorithms and Data Structure category, I have decided to explore the concepts of making a RESTful API from the course CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This project ended with making a RESTful (API) based protocol that was enabled with specific CRUD functionalities. The enhancement plan I am proposing in my portfolio is to explore and use other freely available APIs such as COVID-19 tracking API to create an application that would display visual information if not data information regarding the status of COVID cases all over the world and in the states of USA in this trying time. This is achieved by writing source codes in Python that would make use of two API’s available online to create an application of some use. 

The enhancement plan demonstrates the skills to solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices. These skills in turn align to course outcomes such as an attempt to improve efficiency of the chosen artifact or the concepts behind API in this case by using a different algorithm and the free API created by other resources. 

------------------------------------------------------- 

Creating a graphical database 

For the Database category, I chose the idea of MongoDB from the course CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. All the databases used for this class were not graphical at all with lot of them having readability factor almost non-existent. My intended plan is to explore a way to create a visual display of a database that has been used for this class. This is an attempt to make a huge database look much easier for interpretation and analysis.  

The enhancement plan illustrates the skills to explore the techniques and tools that help implement computer solutions and help accomplish industry-specific goals. The outcome these skills align to is the presentation of a JSON database in a graphical format using a different tool and a programming language than what were used previously for the class.
