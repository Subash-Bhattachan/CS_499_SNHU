## Professional Self-Assessment
Always been fond of creating things, designing or exploring the various ranges of creativity, I have been a visual person with strong liking for colors, graphics or details. While coding did not interest me at all back home, most probably, because I was conveniently unaware about computer science field and its scope during those periods, but this viewpoint took a complete turn as time went by. In the meantime, I moved to the United States and I sensed a need to update my career prospects for the better job security and satisfaction. I decided to further my studies.  

Coming to SNHU, I realized the courses that were based on visual exposition captivated me a lot and some of them were namely CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization where I learnt about creating three-dimensional objects using OpenGL language, API libraries and computer graphics development best practices. The class also equipped me with knowledge to create interactive graphics applications that would allow navigation around the three-dimensional object created. Another class that fascinated me was IT 315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design, where I learnt to apply object-oriented techniques and methods in analyzing and designing software systems. Precisely, I learnt to create UML functional, structural and behavioral models that are clearly articulated and based on software system requirements. I discovered that a whole software application can be illustrated in the relevant UML diagrams. Subsequently, I realized that a software developer can contribute to the development of computer graphics and for myself, as an aspiring computer science professional, I can pursue this field as a career choice as well.  

SNHU offered me more than these two opportunities to learn and broaden my horizon. For example, through the class CS 250: Software Development Lifecycle, I learnt about the impact of various roles to the software development process. I was introduced to the agile development methodologies in relation to efficient completion of software design projects. I got a chance to conduct various communication approaches relative to the roles, such as product owner, scrum master, developer, tester at different stages of the software design process. Similarly, taking a class CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance, I was able to know more about software-engineering testing strategies and practices while learning how software quality assurance techniques are used through the software development life cycle. The biggest takeaways from this class I would say are learning to incorporate the Test-driven development (TDD) and to limit the bias I may have as a developer or a tester throughout the software development process. 

Similarly, CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms was quite insightful as a class, as I got an opportunity to apply technically sound data structures and algorithms to perform the various required functions including searches and sorts. The knowledge helped me much while writing efficient and optimized computer programs in my other classes and projects as well. Through class such as DAT 220: Fundamentals of Data Mining, I learnt a lot about identifying meaningful patterns in a data by using strategies such as hypothesis testing and data-driven discovery methods. Here I was introduced to a statistical analysis program called JMP to conduct data-mining tasks such as classification, clustering and sequential pattern discovery and generate research questions by using the right data mining and research techniques.  

Taking CS 310: Collaboration and Team Project, I became much aware about utilizing appropriate industry-standard tools and techniques for version control in software development and applied collaboration strategies for addressing team-level software development environments. I also assessed the collaborative process for its ability to promote effective communication in team-based development projects. CS 410: Reverse Software Engineering  whereas, taught me about recovering, recreating and rewriting the code for applications by focusing on assembly code which acts as a bridge between machine code and the higher-level coding languages.  

Some of the worth mentioning classes that came along my way are IT 145: Foundation in Application Development that exposed me to the design, implementation and understanding of computer programs. Here I learnt about the key concepts of object orientation, including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and communication with messages. Topics such as classes and objects, base classes and class hierarchies, and abstract and concrete classes were explored as well. And In the class IT 365: Operating Environments, I came across the major components of operating systems and their role in supporting different processes. I analyzed how process and memory management function within an operating system during application development and analyzed operating systems on how they approach user protection and security.  

With time and my studying at SNHU, my thinking about my career plan has evolved for sure. Now I have realized that there are so many routes that as a computer science professional I can take and not be restricted or limited to one area of specialization only. With so much strength and skills that I have garnered from taking several classes, some of which I have discussed in the above paragraphs, I feel I am now prepared to enter the professional scene of the computer science field and contribute in the most productive way possible. Though I intend to pursue my career choices in computer graphics direction, Artificial Intelligence, Game Design and Software Engineering also fascinate my imaginations a lot. I hope in future, I will be able to somehow combine my love for creative expositions with programming skills in one or couple of these specialization areas of Computer Science. 

### Summary of the improvised artifacts
Controlling the ram head through GUI 

For the Software Design and Engineering category, I have chosen to go with a project from the course CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. The project for this class ended with writing code for the ram head with a texture and giving some control to users to zoom in and out and turn horizontally and vertically. My enhancement plan is to develop GUI so to display to users the instructions to maneuver around the ram head and the settings to adjust the position and the rotational degree of the head as well. The intent is to make the codes look less intimidating but more playful for users with non-technical background. 

The enhancement plan demonstrates the gained skills to use innovative techniques and tools to implement in the field of computer graphics, the area of specialization that I am planning to go for in future. The outcome these skills align to is a display of an attempt to expand on a project’s complexity by adding further functionalities via GUI to control the ram head. 

------------------------------------------------------- 

Creating an application using a different API 

For the Algorithms and Data Structure category, I have decided to explore the concepts of making a RESTful API from the course CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This project ended with making a RESTful (API) based protocol that was enabled with specific CRUD functionalities. The enhancement plan I am proposing in my portfolio is to explore and use other freely available APIs such as COVID-19 tracking API to create an application that would display visual information if not data information regarding the status of COVID cases all over the world and in the states of USA in this trying time. This is achieved by writing source codes in Python that would make use of two API’s available online to create an application of some use. 

The enhancement plan demonstrates the skills to solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices. These skills in turn align to course outcomes such as an attempt to improve efficiency of the chosen artifact or the concepts behind API in this case by using a different algorithm and the free API created by other resources. 

------------------------------------------------------- 

Creating a graphical database 

For the Database category, I chose the idea of MongoDB from the course CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. All the databases used for this class were not graphical at all with lot of them having readability factor almost non-existent. My intended plan is to explore a way to create a visual display of a database that has been used for this class. This is an attempt to make a huge database look much easier for interpretation and analysis.  

The enhancement plan illustrates the skills to explore the techniques and tools that help implement computer solutions and help accomplish industry-specific goals. The outcome these skills align to is the presentation of a JSON database in a graphical format using a different tool and a programming language than what were used previously for the class.

### Enhancement One

A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? 
For the Software Design/ Engineering category, the artifact that I picked is the ram head modeling and navigation from the class CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. This artifact was created to showcase an example of an organized geometry with low-polygon while representing a real-world object. A suitable texture was utilized here and was given a look of a sculpture with appropriate lighting to highlight the ram head’s features.

B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved? 
The reason I selected this artifact for my final project was because I thought I could expand on the complexity of the application that I created for the class CS 330. I, as well intend to improve this application further by involving the users in some way as before everything was in code and it was only the programmers who know how to navigate around the ram head or how to change the settings of navigation to one’s desires. The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in software development would be the preparations of the environment in terms of Eclipse IDE that were conducted before even introducing the idea of GUI to the whole picture. There were lot of research and analysis done to set the environment by downloading the correct header libraries and then placing them in the right positions to start designing GUI of my choice. I downloaded the ImGui library and wrote specific ImGui functions to facilitate the graphical user interface in the otherwise quite static and closed application but have to admit that I struggled a lot to get the library work correctly.

C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
I have my plan as to how to design Gui over the ram head as , but what is holding me back is all the technical details that I needed to learn in order to make the application run accordingly. I went through so much frustration in this process. The header files were giving me many problems as without resolving the issues the header files offered, I could not really move ahead even with my goals and planning done ahead. My plan number two is to try this whole application in Visual Studio as Eclipse IDE is temperamental as it is (as per what I experienced) and see if I can get the Gui working as what I have planned of. The picture below was/ is what my expectations are/ were.

D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
I faced a lot of challenges while carrying out this project. The first one was having to download the software application with all required libraries and folders, and this was after the class was over and done with. Once the application was up and running, then I had to go through old tutorials and do a lot of reading to understand what was being done in my old assignments. After this, I had to study a lot about how to create a GUI over the screen that holds a 3d object already. I came to know there were many GUI libraries that one can use, but some of them that topped the list were Dear ImGui, FlatGui, GLUI etc. After this, I downloaded ImGui as it sounded like a fair deal to me.
The header files were quite complicated to understand in one attempt. In case of ImGui, I came to learn that the here the header files and some selected source files have to be together in the same folder for me to be able to use some of the Gui functions in code and avoid any ‘undefined references’. I understood the strategy to create Gui and all the required artifacts within the interface, but the preliminary actions that I was required to take before even starting to code Gui is what took me so much time. Now my IDE is reading out an error message saying that it cannot find -lglfw library, and it is there but with a different name glfw3, and I am lost as to how to link the right file and there are a couple of GLFW functions used in the code to create Gui. I read a lot about making Cmakelists.txt file to assign right files or create a duplicate library file etc. to move forward, but the problem is that we did not really learn to make Cmakelists file in that class, and I am not much confident to say that it will completely solve the lingering problem.

So what I learnt through the whole process is that the software design and development is not an easy process to talk about and especially when you are the only one in the design and development process setting goals and making decisions. I also learnt about the importance of all the preliminary steps that need to be carried out to get the software application working to your desire. It maybe because I lack professional experience and aimed for some bigger project goals that I faced some serious challenges, but I have scaled back now and am hoping to just create a simple functioning Gui for this project eventually and I am working on it still (while addressing my other responsibilities for this class as well) and would sincerely appreciate the guidance and feedback from my professor on how to move forward. 

UPDATES:

 
After being able to remove some 40 errors down to 20 and now to 1. The IDE is still looking for this header file lgflw, which I guess technically meant glfw. The file is there but with a different name glfw3 and I could not link that file in place of glfw as the application is asking for. 
The picture below gives a glimpse of what I was trying to do in Gui coding and as one can see, I was able to use the ImGui functions well without any problems after a long time, but as the application is not able to find the header file lglfw, I could not really run it to see for myself. Through my research, I learnt that Eclipse not being able to find -lgflw is a common problem that programmers go through and there were some complex solutions given as well where they were using cMakelists file or using some gcc command line operations in DOS operating system to mitigate the problem but this may not be our course objectives I believe(?).

### Enhancement Two

A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created? 
The artifact chosen for Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure is RESTful (API) web-based protocol from CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts. This framework was here enabled with specific CRUD functionality and is tested and validated by using URIs linked in the prompt. Also, a web service application was developed to implement the RESTful API for a MongoDB database and this involved some advanced querying. 

B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?
Making a RESTful API grew my interest to know more about how APIs developed by other resources would function and what kind of benefits can one take out of them. I selected this artifact because as a computer science student, I got inspired to explore further on this whole idea of creating API artifact and see now if I can use freely available APIs and independently make any application that can be of some use to general people. Though I did mention in my first refinement plan of displaying visual information through the application designed but had to scale back after learning that it might require some dedicated studying and application development planning to add the visual factor to the whole presentation of database extracted from API. Hopefully this will be my future project I will pursue later in future.
For this enhancement plan, I wrote the code in Python with various functionalities that were inspired from CRUD functionality in a developed RESTful API framework and integrated two different APIs to offer two options so as to display the latest information regarding COVID-19 virus to the users. Instead of MongoDB, here this application uses the sea of information offered by the API’s to bring forward the requested information. The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure would be the strategies employed to make others’ API work to my desire. As the algorithms used to make the most out of a free API (or data structure) are different than what was used with RESTful API for CS 340, I believe they will successfully highlight my achieved skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure in the process.

C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
I had started this enhancement with an objective to expand the complexity to the artifact RESTful API or to the whole concept of building an API and hopefully I have tried my best to meet the course objectives through this enhancement I am proposing. Here in this case, I believe not only have I been able to expand the complexity by using completely different data structures and algorithms for the artifact I chose but also I have tried to bring forth some fruitful usage to general public through the application designed.

UPDATES:
Following are the screenshot of the code snippets in Python and the compiled code in python shell. The API’s have made it easier and efficient to get the data from anywhere in the world and around the United States quite effortlessly. My understanding of algorithms and data structures got much stronger and informed after making this application. Hopefully the next step in future is to make this application much portable in apps format. I may need more investigations and research to go in that direction. 

Professor Conlan, 
I would appreciate your feedbacks as usual.
Thank you.

D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
This is the first time I am making a simple application of some use while using the freely available API on the internet. The process left me thinking more about a lot of other APIs that I may have skipped or missed exploring. The experience taught me that the sky is the limit to what can be done with any API that are just thrown to us at disposal. 
The challenges I faced while making this simple application was trying to get hold of the appropriate API that can be used in my application. There were several APi’s being offered online that are tracking COVID-19 cases in their own set variables, so it was a struggle for me to get the right API that I can use to create the application I was planning. Some APi’s demand time and understanding to learn how to work around them, and some even required money, but finally I was able to use two of them that met my specifications of the application. Also, I was planning to make a web application somewhere in the line of apps on mobile cell phones, but in the middle, I realized that I have to spend much time to understand the various technical details to make this application web based, but with whatever work I was able to accomplish making it a computer application, I feel motivated to keep working on this application to convert it to a platforms- friendly one and make it more available for everybody meaning even for the audience who are not from the computer science field or technical background.
